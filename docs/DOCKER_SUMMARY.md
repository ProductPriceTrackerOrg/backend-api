# Docker Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the Docker implementation for the PricePulse API backend.

## Files Created

1. **Dockerfile**

   - Base image: Python 3.11-slim
   - Installs required system dependencies
   - Sets up the application environment
   - Uses custom entrypoint script

2. **.dockerignore**

   - Prevents unnecessary files from being copied into the image
   - Improves build speed and reduces image size

3. **docker-compose.yml**

   - Production configuration
   - Maps port 8000 to host
   - Mounts GCP credentials
   - Configures environment variables
   - Includes healthcheck

4. **docker-compose.dev.yml**

   - Development configuration with hot reloading
   - Maps local files into the container
   - Includes Redis service for caching
   - Configured for debugging

5. **docker-entrypoint.sh**

   - Startup script that runs inside the container
   - Validates GCP credentials presence
   - Shows environment information
   - Starts uvicorn server

6. **docker-helper.sh**

   - CLI tool for managing Docker operations
   - Provides commands for build, up, down, logs, etc.
   - Simplifies Docker usage for team members

7. **docker-test.sh**

   - Helper script to run tests inside the Docker container
   - Can run specific test files or all tests
   - Provides feedback on test status

8. **DOCKER_SETUP.md**

   - Basic setup instructions
   - Quick start guide
   - Environment variable configuration

9. **DOCKER_GUIDE.md**

   - Comprehensive guide for working with Docker
   - Development workflow instructions
   - Testing and production deployment guidance
   - Troubleshooting common issues

10. **.github/workflows/docker-ci.yml**
    - GitHub Actions workflow for CI
    - Builds and tests the Docker image
    - Creates mock credentials for testing
    - Verifies health endpoint functionality

## Using the Docker Setup

### Development

```bash
# Start development environment with hot reloading
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

# Run tests in the container
./docker-test.sh

# View logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs -f
```

### Production

```bash
# Build and start production containers
docker-compose up -d

# Check container status
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

### Helper Script

```bash
# Show available commands
./docker-helper.sh help

# Common operations
./docker-helper.sh build    # Build the image
./docker-helper.sh up       # Start services
./docker-helper.sh down     # Stop services
./docker-helper.sh logs     # Show logs
```

## Environment Variables

All environment variables should be configured in the `.env` file, which is referenced by docker-compose. See `.env.example` for the required variables.

## GCP Credentials

The `gcp-credentials.json` file is mounted into the container as a read-only volume. Make sure this file is present and has the correct permissions for BigQuery access.

## Next Steps

1. Consider implementing CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment
2. Add monitoring and logging solutions (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana)
3. Configure database backups if using stateful services
4. Implement proper secrets management for production credentials
